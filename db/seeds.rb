        summary: "<p>Early in the afternoon, Mark got a report that a cow and bull pair of killer whales had been spotted near Albert Head and were making their way towards Victoria. He and Joe mobilized Mike 1 and departed the dock in Victoria at 1450. By the time they reached Ogden Point, the whales were almost in sight of the harbour, just north east of Albert Head. The female had not been seen in roughly 40 minutes prior to their arrival, but a large bull was clearly visible on the horizon. Mark and Joe slowed and began the encounter at 1505 at 48 24.4 N/ 123 24.5 W (a mile and half south of Ogden Point).</p><p>The bull surfaced nearby and was confirmed to be T010C, so it was assumed that his mom T010 was the second whale. Sure enough, after ~10 minutes tracking the large male a second animal appeared just ahead of him, milling in place. With the distinctive notch near the base of her dorsal fin T010 was confirmed. The two whales continued working the area, apparently after a seal, though no other marine mammal was ever observed. The predation event began at 1522 at 48 23.7 N/ 123 23.6 W. For close to an hour the pair circled and dove, disappearing for over five minutes at times, only to reappear in the same spot, drifting closer to the waterfront with the current. They finally finished the hunt at 1617 at 48 24.0 N/ 123 23.6 W. The smell and oil slick at the surface drew in all the local gulls and the whales turned back to the west once they had finished prey sharing. They initially looked as though they were going to enter Victoria harbour but chose to cross the mouth and continue west towards Royal Roads.</p><p>The T010's are two of only a handful of Bigg's known to enter the harbour on more than one occasion, having done so several times in the past decade, the most recent being just over two years ago.</p><p>Mark and Joe ended the encounter there at 1655 at 48 24.8 N/ 123 23.7 W and taxied into the harbour."

        summary: "<p>Ken called Dave to relay a report that “Spirit of Orca” had found a group of whales heading northeast in the Blunden Island area. Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1335. We arrived on scene about a mile and a half west of Skipjack Island around 1410. The whales were very active with one main group of young whales doing most of the splashing and rolling around. This group was doing all sorts of behaviors-very few of them fitting nicely into our behavior categories. A few of the older whales were loosely spread within a 100 yards of the play group. Another pair of sub-adults were rolling around together a few dozen yards to the side of the younger whales. At least one of these two was a male. The transients turned out to be the T49As and the T71s-11 whales in total. One of the two subadults was T49A3, who we know to be a male, but the other was T71C and he (?) certainly looked and acted like another pre-sprouter male. The youngest whales present (T49A5 and T71B2) switched back and forth between traveling slightly ahead with their mothers and going back to join the fun in the rear play group.</p><p>The T49As and T71s traveled northeast toward Patos Island. They briefly looked like they were heading for the east end of the island before turning and heading back west. The whales rounded Alden Point on Patos Island and then turned east again along the north side of the island. They then continued east along the north side of Sucia and Matia Islands passing, at various points, Steller sea lions and harbor seals hauled out on the rocks. Other than a couple of brief periods where the whales spread out a little and did a little milling, no serious hunting was observed and the whales remained social for the entire encounter. We ended the encounter at 1745 about a mile northwest of Barnes and Clark Islands with the whales heading southeast.</p>"

Five hours had passed since the 1000 report and when they were ~20 nm south east of the reported position they scanned for close to 15 minutes in flat calm seas to only see many harbour porpoise. They felt that with the building ebb current it was unlikely the whales were to the east so they proceeded west as far as Victor Foxtrot and after another good binocular scan they headed for Race Rocks and then made their way to Victoria harbour. At 1618 they received another second hand report from Paul that a group of east bound killer whales were spotted from shore near Otter Point. Mike 1 turned around and headed that way and Paul departed his dock and located the reported whales within a half mile of the Sooke bluffs a few minutes before Mark and Val arrived at 1700.

He and Hanna were at the Ten Mile Point lookout watching sunrise and scanning for whales at that time and could see the perfect water conditions, so Mark arranged with his carpenter to take the morning off to find the group reported to the north.<br/<They left Victoria harbour at 0845 on Mike 1 and made their way north up the west side of Haro Strait. Mark had contacted Lisa Moorby on North Pender Island to see if she could keep a lookout from shore as his friend reported that the large group was last seen heading northwest up the middle of Swanson Channel south of the Pender Bluffs. He had later called Mark to report a single male trailing the group near Gooch Island that Mark figured was T010C by a decent iPhone photo that was forwarded to him.</p><p>When Lisa couldn't see any sign of them from the lookout near Mouat Point, it made sense to head to the last known position as it appeared that they must have stalled out or turned around.</p><p>Mark and Bernie stopped to do a binocular scan when they got slightly north of Gooch Island, and with no sign of any blows or fins towards Stuart and Pender, they continued north up the east side of Moresby. At 0953, as they rounded Pelorus Point, they saw a group of killer whales off their bow coming towards them. They put the brakes on, and Mark immediately recognized the T010's and T049A's as they completed their last breath before going into a long dive. As Mike 1 trolled along back to the south waiting for the next sequence, Mark spotted more animals behind them at the north end of Moresby Island. He had a look through his Swarovski's and could see that they were milling as if on a kill and then saw an animal from the original group porpoising back to the north at Pelorus Point. They caught up to what turned out to be T049A2 leading the charge with the others sauntering along a couple hundred metres behind. Mike 1 and T049A2 arrived in unison to see T063, T065, the T049B's, and the T071's milling about in a social group. There was no evidence of a kill as there was no sign of a slick, birds, or any prey. The T049A's joined in the socialization, which lasted for several minutes as they slowly worked their way north up Swanson Channel within a quarter-mile of Moresby Island. The T010's were tight to the shore and didn't seem interested in joining the social group of 18 animals.</p><p>Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1054 as the animals reached the top end of Moresby Island and started to fan out as they continued traveling north on a line for Active Pass. As they were taxiing away past Canoe Rock, Mark received a report of another group of 3 killer whales southbound in Active Pass. He had promised Bernie to have him back to the dock by 1230, so he decided to leave them for Morningstar to confirm as they were on their way to check out the whales Mike 1 had found. Mark later heard that Morningstar had confirmed the T099s joined them from the north. This group of 23 were last seen in Trincomali Channel, which eventually parted ways with the T010's, T063, T065, and the 099's continuing north and the T049A's, T049B's and the T071's headed back south.</p>"

The first whales we saw were the J16s traveling slowly southeast toward San Juan Channel. J36 detached from the rest of the J16s and moved on ahead of the other three. Another whale was about a mile to the southeast of the J16s and other whales could be seen spread out over a mile ahead of us in the White Rock area. A few spread out whales could be seen foraging deep in Mouatt Bay. We moved from one spread out whale to the next spread out whale as J pod moved slowly SE past White Rock and Flattop Island. Some whales moved toward Orcas Island and came around the corner of Jones Island while entering San Juan Channel while others moved over to the San Juan Island shoreline. We were seeing the occasional fish chase so foraging was going on.</p><p>Once the whales made it into San Juan Channel, one or two groups began to form. J36, J37, J40, and J49 formed a loose group where J36 and J49 were rolling around and splashing together. We also found J44 and J53 traveling quietly together behind most of the other whales. These two were being gently tactile with one another. Another large social group began forming as the whales approached the Wasp Islands. This large milling group included the previous foursome along with the J22s, J41s, and J39. We then dropped back to the trailing whales with hopes of finding individuals we had not seen yet that day. We found J27 but the other whales back near the trailers were a couple members of the J16s again.

They had not quite picked up speed when a small cetacean appeared just a half-mile off the bow, and as it surfaced again, it was clearly a small humpback! After spending 20 unsuccessful minutes attempting to collect an ID photo of the youngster's tail fluke, the trio decided to loop back to the Bigg's. Radio relays suggested that the group had perhaps nabbed a seal, though when Mike 1 arrived back on scene, there were no signs of predation. The animals were tightly grouped and high-speed porpoising towards Race Rocks and the southwest, though they were making little more than 5 knots over the bottom fighting a strong flood current. After collecting a few right-side ID shots, The Mike 1 crew ended the encounter two miles east of William Head at 48 19.9 N/123 29.0 W and turned for the harbour at 1605.

We filed this info away while we continued our J pod encounter with hopes that they would take us close enough to Cattle Pass that we could rationalize temporarily leaving the residents to take a look at the pair of transients.</p><p>When we were near Hein Bank with J pod, we received another report of a group of whales near MacArthur Bank that did not seem like it could be J pod whales. Since we were having trouble finding the very spread out J pod whales that we knew were around, we decided to go investigate. Our search took us over towards Iceberg Point and then we headed over to the Whale Rock area in Cattle Pass hoping that T77A and T124C got lost in Griffin Bay for a couple of hours. When we were near Whale Rocks, we received another report that someone had seen a pair of male killer whales about halfway between Colville Island and Smith Island. The weather and water were beautiful so we decided to keep searching and turned around and headed southeast toward Minor Island. The sighting conditions were excellent so it was a little discouraging that we hadn’t seen anything yet as we approached the area just a little north of Minor Island. We were about a half mile east of Minor Island and beginning to think the pair of Ts had disappeared as they had lots of directions that they could have headed. We were feeling a bit disappointed and, since we were there, decided to circumnavigate Smith and Minor Islands before heading home when Katie spotted the whales to the south of us in the middle of a sun streak.</p><p>We got to the whales at about 1320 about a half mile south of Minor Island right as they went on a long dive. When they came up again the two were tight together heading slowly south-southeast. After their next long dive, the pair surfaced about a quarter mile apart, paralleling each-other's course. Around 1355, the two whales turned and began approaching one another at a bit quicker pace making us think that they may have found something. We then noticed a large, very freaked out Steller sea lion performing evasive maneuvers. While we never saw the whales surface near the sea lion, it was obvious they checked it out and briefly tested it before, disappointingly, moving on. When the pair came up again, they were back together traveling slowly south-southeast. The encounter ended at 1416 with T77A and T124C still traveling slowly south-southeast about halfway between Minor Island and Partridge Point on Whidbey Island, just a little north of the eastern part of Partridge Bank.</p>"

Both K and L pod were seen in Puget Sound the previous day and L pod was of particular interest because there appeared to be a new calf. “Morning Star” headed straight to Admiralty Inlet. Not long after, J pod was seen heading toward Discovery Island/Constance Bank area from the west side of San Juan Island.\n\n“Morning Star” spotted blows at the northern end of Admiralty Inlet at 0930, about a mile northeast of Point Wilson. It was all of K pod sleepily traveling northwest in a tight group. Everyone was accounted for, including K25. K25 remains thin, but it appears that his condition has not worsened.\n\nIt wasn’t long until more blows were seen a few hundred yards behind K pod. It was all of L pod grouped up and also slowly heading northwest. “Morning Star” moved from K pod to L pod to find the new calf. All of L pod was accounted for and L77’s new calf, L124, was confirmed at 0950. The calf appeared to be about 3 weeks old and was bouncing around between L25, L41, L77 L85, and L119. A gender was not revealed during the encounter but there will hopefully be more opportunities in the future.\n\nMultiple social groups formed in L pod and many of the males, both young and old, were especially playful. As L pod exited Admiralty Inlet, even more whales became surface active with tail slaps, pec slaps, cartwheels, breaches, and spy hops. Up ahead, K pod had already exited the inlet and was still heading northwest.\n\nBy 1030, L pod was 1/3 mile due south of the SA buoy, still heading northwest but had increased their speed to 4-5 knots. K pod remained in a tight group to the west of L pod. Once southeast of Hein Bank, L pod began to disperse into smaller groups and picked their speed up to 6-7 knots. As the Ls were spreading out to the east, some the whales, especially the L4s and L47s, became surface active again. K pod also became surface active off to the west. It was clear that K and L pod could hear J pod and were eager to join them. “Morning Star” stayed with some of the L12s and L54s, but the L54s were not in such a hurry and fell behind.\n\nThe new calf kept up well with L25, L41, L77, and L119 as they sped northwest. “Morning Star” then decided to see where K pod went off to and re-acquired almost all of K pod in a tight group at 1310, southeast of Constance Bank. Then, news came in from whale watching boats that J pod was up ahead. K pod became surface active again as they closed the gap between them and J pod. Up ahead, some of Ls, including the L12s, had already reached J pod and were beginning to socialize. K pod arrived on scene soon after and joined the social groups that were forming.\n\nIt appeared the all of J pod was around and J17 was seen a few times, though a health shot was not acquired. If all of J pod was indeed there, than all 75 of the endangered southern resident orcas were in the same area together. “Morning Star” moved around the spread out social groups and found some trailing whales that were a little late to the party. Some of the L4s, the L72s, L47s, and the L54s slowly headed toward J, K, and the rest of L pod. The encounter was ended at 1430 near Constance Bank as the last two trailers, L88 and L117, continued toward the gathering."

Since the whales were reported to be K pod, Dave grabbed his gear, headed for Snug Harbor, and left in “Orcinus” at 1455. Dave arrived on scene about a half mile south of Trial Island at 1530. The whales were very spread out and traveling slowly west. K21 and the K20s were the first whales encountered and seemed to be the most northerly and westerly of the whales. Since there was not much daylight left and the whales were so spread out, the priority was to find K25 and document how he was doing health-wise.\nAfter looking all over, and seeing a few more spread out whales like the K27s, Dave was able to get on K25 with the help of “Strong Tide” who re-found him and called Dave over. Upon approach, K25 surfaced from a very long, long dive and seemed to be foraging. He soon straightened out and headed west-surfacing many times in a row, cooperatively, and Dave was able to get the shots he needed before it was time to leave due to failing light. The encounter ended with K25 heading west south of the Victoria waterfront at 1615. While K25 did not look 100% healthy, neither did it look like his health worsened much since we last received really good photos of him from October 12th. It is too early to say whether he will survive this latest health scare but it is encouraging that he has not deteriorated further since looking pretty bad back in September and may have actually improved some.\nMany thanks to “Strong Tide” for helping \"Orcinus\" get on the whales and finding K25.​Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

        summary: "Jane Cogan called Dave at home to report that she was hearing resident calls on her hydrophone. Dave then called Kelley and they met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1115. Jane had called again to say the whales were heading south way over on the Canadian side of Haro Strait so we headed southwest and around a freighter to where they ought to be.\nWe saw our first whale at 1125 about a mile or so south of Kelp Reef. The whales were extremely spread out over the Canadian side of the strait and we only saw a few individuals and one small group. All the whales we could see were heading southerly toward Beaumont Shoal and Seabird Point on Discovery Island. The first whale we saw was L115 before we moved to a distant small group that included L72, L105, L90, and L103. So, we had at least the group of 18 L pod whales that included the L4, L47, and L72 matrilines plus L90. Since the other whales were so sparse and hard to find, plus the lack of any males larger than L105, it made us suspect that these 18 Ls were the only residents here. Most of the whales were taking long dives and a few distant individuals looked like they could be foraging.\nA little after we left the group of four, we found L83 and L110 but other whales were still just singles in the distance until we started to approach Seabird Point. As we had expected, the distant animals started to funnel together as they approached Seabird Point around 1245. All the other L4s appeared along with our L72s, L90, and L103 group. As the whales rounded Seabird Point, they turned southwest and traveled toward Trial Island in several small groups. Other than a small tight group of L4s, the whales began to spread out again as they crossed the Oak Bay flats. By this point in the encounter, we had seen 15 of the 18 whales we had expected to see that day and suspected that the three we were missing (L47, L91, and L122) were well to the south of us. The Cogans came out in their boat “Morning Star” with Melisa aboard and we sent them to look to the south for our last three whales. They soon called to say that they did indeed find the remaining L47s that we hadn’t seen yet. From the look of it, the L47s were a good three to four miles south of the more northerly whales we were with. The whales were still heading west when we ended the encounter at 1415 off the Victoria waterfront.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388and Be Whale Wise Guidelines"

Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1415 aboard “Orcinus”. At 1454, “Orcinus” arrived on scene with the J16s about three-quarters of a mile west of the Patos Island lighthouse. J16, J36, and J42 were traveling east tight together. J26 was paralleling them a few hundred yards to the north and swam over to join them soon after.\n\nTo the north, the rest of J pod was spread out but slowly coming together into social groups as they also headed east. At 1538, “Orincus” left the J16s as they took the southern side of Patos Island and headed over to the rest of the pod, which took the northern side. The largest of the social groups was made up of J19, J22, J37, J38, J41, and J49. They were less than a quarter of a mile from the Patos shoreline and were surface active with occasional tail slaps, pec slaps, and spy hops. It wasn’t long until J27, J31, and J39 joined the larger group from further inshore. Goofing off and trailing slightly behind were J40, J45, and J51.\n\nJ40, J45, and J51 caught up with the larger group (which now contained all of the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s) as it neared Toe Point and many of the whales became more surface active with frequent tail slaps, inverted tail slaps, and pec slaps. At 1605, the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s cleared Patos Island and continued east toward Lummi Island. The J16s had also cleared Patos by this time and could be seen in the distance to the south, also aiming toward Lummi.\n\nAt 1618, the J16s joined the J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s and they all turned south toward President Channel, though they seemed a bit indecisive about it at first. The encounter was ended at 1631 as the whales slowly swam south along the Sucia Island shoreline toward Present Channel. The J17s and L87 were not present during the encounter so the CWR will wait for another J pod encounter to confirm how J17 is fairing.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

She then called back a half hour later to relay a report that whales had been seen heading north near Lime Kiln. Dave grabbed his stuff and headed first to the County Park to take a look from shore. At least one whale was seen way offshore of the park and “Sea Lion” came from the north and slowed down for something offshore of CWR. Jeanne Hyde reported seeing a small group of whales to the southwest of the leaders. Dave then headed on to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1550.\nAs “Orcinus” putted out of the harbor, “Sea Lion” was seen nearing Kellett Bluff and Ken was also out in “Tonto”. “Orcinus” headed southwest out of Mitchell Bay to try to find the group Jeanne had seen. Jane called on the radio to report that the three whales who had passed her place were the J19s and that was who was probably near Kellett Bluff. After about 20 minutes of searching, Dave finally saw his first whale mid-strait off Mitchell Bay. This was J39 who foraged a little before passing the boat and continuing north. There were no other whales in sight so “Orcinus” headed in the direction of Kelp Reef. After another fifteen minutes, a small group was seen about three quarters of a mile to the north of Kelp Reef. This was J16, J36, J42, and J31 traveling in a group together. At least two males and a possible third whale could now be seen spread back across the strait off the south end of Mitchell Bay. All the whales were taking extremely long dives and were easy to miss when they finally came up again. Dave overshot the nearest male who was at least a half mile to the southeast of the small group and went to see the far male instead. This was J27 and he was foraging about a mile off Kellett Bluff. The other male seen earlier was seen again well to the west off the southeast end of Sydney Island.

        summary: "After a series of phone calls from Jane Cogan relaying reports of a group of transients heading up San Juan Channel, Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after 1500. We arrived on scene at about 1530 in Spieden Channel. The whales, already identified as the T90s and T101s, were traveling slowly west near the southeastern shoreline of Spieden Island. Most of the whales were in one tight group with T101A being the lone outlier traveling a couple of hundred yards ahead of the others. The whales moved a little offshore as they moved west. When they were adjacent to Sentinel Island, they began to wake up and T101B did a big belly flop which he followed with a half breach.\nSoon after, the whales started to loosen up and began feeding on something. They may have made an inconspicuous kill then but there is also chance that the whales had killed a sea lion prior to our arrival and were carrying it for most of the way through Spieden Channel before feeding upon it. We never did get a good look at what they killed but the whales were feeding and socializing in the same area around the west end of Spieden Island for over an hour and a half. Since the whales weren’t going anywhere, much of the encounter was spent with the engine off while the whales milled around. We did photo T102 with two big whiskers coming up from the other side of his head so we know they got at least one large pinniped. T101A and T101B were hanging out together around the periphery of the group with occasional forays into the middle of the action. At one point, the two brothers were seen with a large chunk of something while the other whales were feeding on something else a short distance away. Throughout the encounter there were lots of taillobs and other percussive behavior. T90C breached several times and, later in the encounter, was spyhopping repeatedly. Towards the end, the whales were socializing and acting quite confident. We ended the encounter at 1745 off the west end of Spieden Island with the T90s and T101s beginning to move northwest toward Stuart Island.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388Video taken under Be Whale Wise Guidelines"

Several whales from this group stopped and briefly logged at the surface. After a long dive, the whales moved more into the middle of lower Swanson Channel and began to wake up a bit. T10 did two big cartwheels and T2C did one. A whale appeared from the north and this turned out to be T2C3. T2C3 logged briefly at the surface about a quarter of a mile north of the other whales when all the whales went on another long dive. When the whales came up again, T2C3 had re-joined the group and everybody continued north.\n“Morning Star” had left the scene a while ago and had gone on a whale search up Boundary Pass toward East Point. A bit before 1300, they found the T49As near East Point heading quickly southwest down Boundary Pass. “Orcinus” left the T2Cs and T10s at about 1310 in mid-Swanson Channel to head over to where the T49As were in Boundary Pass, arriving on scene mid-way between Blunden Island and Johns Pass twenty minutes later. South of South Pender Island, the whales turned west with T49A1 about a half mile to the south of the other T49As. All the T49As were traveling fast and T49A1 was on a converging course with the others. T49A1 joined the rest of the T49As by the time they turned north at the south end of Swanson Channel.\nBy this time, we had heard that the T2Cs and T10s had turned around and were heading south again in Swanson Channel. At 1400, the T49As had slowed down and were traveling in a tight group just a little north of Moresby Island. The T10s and T2Cs were briefly seen logging at the surface north of the T49As off Mouat Point before they went on a long dive. Suddenly four or five new whales appeared heading south about three quarters of a mile north of the T49As and then all the whales went on a long dive. After an extremely long long dive, all the whales came up a good distance away heading very quickly southeast toward the Pender Bluffs. Almost all the whales were in one single socializing group close in to the dark rocks of the bluff. T19B and T19C were identified so now we knew at least the T18s had joined up with the others. T2C2 also appeared well offshore of the others where he kept a low profile. The large group traveled along the rocks as they came down the bluffs, crossed the Bedwell Harbor entrance, and moved east along South Pender Island’s south shoreline. The T10s reappeared traveling almost a half mile behind the large group. T49A1 had moved offshore by himself and appeared to be foraging. T2C2 also showed up traveling slowly all by himself another quarter mile behind the T10s. The encounter ended at 1610 with the large group off the mouth of Plumper Sound and the other four whales still spread out behind them as they all headed slowly up Boundary Pass.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388Video taken under Be Whale Wise Guidelines"

        summary: "With sunny skies and low winds in the forecast, “Morning Star” departed Snug Harbor at 1108 in search of killer whales. At 1120, a whale watching boat found whales heading west in Trincomali Channel. “Morning Star” headed that way and arrived on scene west of Parker Island at 1200. The first whale encountered was T2C2, who has severe scoliosis. He was slowly heading north and trailing behind the rest of the whales by 3/4 of a mile. “Morning Star” took a few proof of presence shots of T2C2 before heading to the northern whales.\n\nThe other whales turned out to be the rest of T2C2’s family and the T123s. They were quickly moving north (7-9 knots) west of Wise Island. Males T2C1 and T123A were rolling around together while the rest of the two families were grouped up a few hundred yards to the north. “Morning Star” continued north to get photos of the remaining members of the T2Cs and T123s as they took the east side of Wallace Island. Occasionally, the T2Cs and T123s would pause and log at the surface for a few minutes. Perhaps they were waiting for T2C2 to catch up but he was still trailing far behind them.\n\nSuddenly, another group of whales appeared a few hundred yards to the west. It was the T49As in a resting line and “Morning Star” saw these whales briefly before they disappeared from view as they slowly headed north on the west side of Wallace Island. At 1255, “Morning Star” left the T2Cs and T123s to get better proof of presence shots of the T49As. The T49As had continued north through Houstoun Passage and were taking ten minute long deep dives. The encounter was ended at 1335 after the T49As went on a long dive off of Squthey Point at the north end of Saltspring Island.Photos taken under Be Whale Wise Guidelines"

        summary: "Ken called Dave at home in the late morning to relay a report that J pod had been found heading slowly down Boundary Pass. Dave grabbed his gear, headed to the boat, and left Snug Harbor around 1145ish. “Orcinus” got to the general area in Boundary Pass around 1215 but the whales were so spread out that it was 1230 before the first whales were seen and encountered.\nThe first group encountered was J36, J41, and J51 and they were about halfway between Blunden Island and Johns Pass. The threesome were socializing as they fast traveled east toward White Rock. About a half mile to the south of these three, J19 and J39 were paralleling each other-spread by about 200 yards-as they also fast traveled east. A male appeared way up ahead in the White Rocks area. This turned out to be J26. J27 also appeared another half mile east of J26 and both of them foraged separately in the area between White Rock and Flattop Island.\nMore whales were seen closer to the Orcas Island shoreline and this turned out to be the J17s, J22s and J40. This group was loosely stretched out as they turned southwest and then filed around the north and west shorelines of Jones Island. J17 herself was present with J53 beside her with the others near Jones Island. Most of the group began milling as they headed slowly southeast on the south side of Jones while J17 began traveling down San Juan Channel by herself a couple of hundred yards ahead of the others. J53 stayed to play with the group. J17 did not have bad breath when the research boat was near her on this day but that may have been a matter of wind direction. L87 and the J37s appeared as they also rounded Jones Island about a quarter mile behind the others and soon joined the milling whales.\nA single whale was seen a few hundred yards to the northwest of the Jones Island group and another group had formed just a little north of O’Neil Island. The single whale turned out to be J45 and he traveled slowly southeast mid-channel by himself until angling toward the whales near Jones Island. By 1445, the J17s, J22s, J14s, and L87 group were only about half a mile southeast of Jones Island before they had turned around and began heading slowly back to the northwest. “Orcinus” headed over to the group north of O’Neal Island and found it to include the J16s, J19s, and J39. These whales were grouped up tight and heading slowly north. Due to an annoying cloud that made things dark (“old man yells at cloud”) plus the whales weren’t arching much, just a few proof of presence shots were taken of this group at the time before moving back to the other group.\nBy 1520, the J14s, J17s, J22s, and L87 group had spread out into singles and small groups all heading slowly northwest. J22, J35, J37, and J40 were in a group together that rolled around a little as they moved in the direction of Spieden Island. J17 and J53 were traveling tightly together a couple of hundred yards behind the foursome. L87 was by himself a couple hundred yards to the north of J17 and J53. The other whales who had been part of the larger group were strung out and socializing several hundred yards behind J17 and J53.\nThe J16s and J19s group had passed Green Point by 1600 and were now traveling west on the north side of Spieden Island. This group had lost J39 but gained J27 and J31. Right before the Cactus Islands, these whales turned north and traveled slowly in a tight group back into Boundary Pass. The rest of J pod and L87 were about three quarters of a mile to the southeast of the J16s, J19s, and J11s and were still spread out in singles and small groups. There was a lot socializing going on in the trailing groups. J39 was actively going after J40 with L87 lingering nearby. J35 breached twice in a row. J38 was playing with some of the younger whales while bringing up the rear. The encounter ended at 1705 about a mile north of the east end of Johns Island with all the whales still heading slowly north in Boundary Pass.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

        summary: "On the morning of 27-Mar-19, whale watching boats found multiple groups of transient killer whales in the vicinity of Rosario Strait. As the day went on, all the groups eventually came together in the Thatcher Pass area of Rosario Strait. Melisa met Tom and Jane at Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1425 aboard “Morning Star”. At 1525, “Morning Star” arrived on scene in Rosario Strait with T46D, who was quickly heading north alone on the east side of Blakely Island. There were two more northbound groups about a quarter of a mile behind T46D, one closer to the middle of Rosario Strait (the T36Bs, T99s, and T137A), and another group farther to the west, closer to the Blakely Island shoreline (the T36As and T49As). Soon after, the T36As and T49As turned to the east, moving closer to the middle of the strait and the other group. The two groups then came together and stalled out to socialize. Many spy hops, aerial scans, half breaches, tail slaps, and pec slaps were observed. Some of the whales were also very tactile with each other.\n\nAt 1645, more whales were spotted to the south, east of Thatcher Pass. “Morning Star” headed that way and found the T46s (minus T46D) and T137s (minus T137A) all grouped up and slowly milling about, seemingly waiting for T46D and T137A to rejoin them. “Morning Star” stayed for a few surfacings before heading back to the big social group. The big social group had since split into three groups and fanned out. The T49As, T99B, and T99C were now heading slowly south as they continued to socialize while the T36As and T36Bs were still slowly heading north as they goofed off and playfully pushed T36B’s calf around at the surface. The third group was made up of T36, T99, T99D, and T137A and they had formed a resting line behind the T36As and T36Bs. Eventually T36, T99, T99D, and T137A turned south and the T36As and T36Bs slowly followed after them.\n\nBy 1730, all of the groups had trickled back into the same area outside of Thatcher Pass. The T46s had arrived from the east and T46D had apparently re-joined the rest of the family at some point. The T49As, T99B, and T99C arrived from the north first, then T36, T99, T99D, and T137A. The T36As and T36Bs brought up the rear and all the whales slowly meandered west toward to the entrance to Thatcher Pass. The T49As then split from the other whales and headed into Thatcher Pass. When this happened, the rest of the whales turned around and headed south in Rosario Strait, hugging the James Island shoreline as they went. The encounter ended at 1805.Photos taken under Be Whale Wise Guidelines"

        summary: "The day began with a plan to travel to Port Townshend by automobile to move our recently refurbished boat to a berthing slip at Point Hudson, strategically very near the Admiralty Inlet to Puget Sound. My very first encounter with J pod was in Admiralty Inlet in April 1976, long before their current popularity, and I hoped for a repeat of a pattern that we have observed with J pod traveling the waters of the Salish Sea in late winter/early spring. K and L pods mostly travel the coastal waters with occasional forays to inland waters when Chinook salmon migrate to their natal rivers to spawn. L pod was off the coast of central California last week, feeding upon Sacramento River Chinook salmon that were aggregating from Monterey to Half Moon Bay. K pod is yet to be located, but no doubt they are either looking for or finding salmon. I expected them all to potentially be coming this way any day soon. Unbeknown to me, J pod had slipped into the Admiralty Inlet during the previous afternoon/evening and in the morning was reported between Kingston and Edmonds, very spread out and not going anywhere. The salmon fishing for winter blackmouth (Chinook) had been pretty good lately, with most fish being 6-8 pounds and big ones up to 13 pounds, so I hoped to see if the whales were also getting in on the “bite”. My plan thus quickly changed from simply moving the boat to breaking in the new engine – running at various speeds for several hours, and attempting to encounter J pod for a quick check on J17. We left Point Hudson at 1220 and headed down the Inlet at various medium speeds, and encountered the first whale one hour later near the northwest edge of the Possession Point “Bar”. The whale, L87, and a fishing buddy that I took to be J49 were taking very long dives and travelling hundreds of yards up and down the Inlet, with gradual progress to the northwest. For half an hour, I saw no other whales before spotting another male fin briefly about a mile south of us. Long dives, changing directions, and brief no-saddle appearances at the surface were the pattern of the day for the whales for the next hour and a half – uneventful, except that a group that we found included J17, J44, J46, and J53, that I had hoped to see. J17 has improved and showed little sign of the “peanut-head” condition that had us very worried during an encounter with her on New Year’s Eve. At 1538, J42 appeared in the vicinity of this group, and gradually more whales began to show up spread out and travelling very slowly up the Inlet toward Double Bluff. By 1608, most of J pod was in an area of about six square miles in the middle of Admiralty Inlet, with many whales at the southerly end of the assemblage engaging in social contact and occasionally (and lazily) lobtailing as they moved gradually up the Inlet. A half a mile or so up the Inlet a few whales were also lazily lobtailing at the surface as they gradually moved down the Inlet. The assemblage gradually coalesced and then headed back down the Inlet toward the Possession Bar. After they surfaced and dove again, I checked out a few of the swirls of whale “tracks” looking for prey remains and scale samples, but saw none. A few small glittery specks were deep in the water column, and I presume any feeding was done near the bottom where blackmouth salmon are usually caught ten feet above the bottom in this region. We left the whales at 1624 as they headed back toward the Bar where the sport fishing fleet was working the incoming tide.On the morning of 8 April, 2019 J pod was observed heading up Haro Strait passing Lime Kiln lighthouse on San Juan Island as they continued their widely spread foraging expedition in the Salish Sea (the report of J pod in Puget Sound was sent to me by Alisa Lemire-Brooks). Judging by the time they spend in these inland marine waters, this habitat is a more important feeding area to them than it is to K or L pods that now rarely venture into the region. We will continue to keep track of all of the SRKWs that come into these core waters, and we also photo-document the Transient groups that now increasingly frequent the Salish Sea. Between Orca Network and their public sighting system, the marine naturalists of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, and our Center for Whale Research will document the whale distribution and condition in a changing world climate that will have a huge effect on the Pacific Northwest. Already, the effects are being felt with temperatures unfavorable to their salmon prey, and ocean acidification destroying the food chain due to excessive atmospheric CO2 from burning fossil fuels. These iconic animals are the canaries in the coal mine for the marine species that our life depends upon, and it is only common sense that we humans do whatever natural salmon recovery is necessary for their survival, rather than wasting money and concern over ephemeral noise issues and government agendas that are impossible to honestly evaluate. We absolutely know that SRKW survival is directly correlated with Chinook salmon abundance, and we also know that native wild salmon will ultimately provide the only path to salmon recovery. The only question is will we remove the dams blocking their natural lifecycle and restore habitats necessary for native salmon recovery,… before it is too late?Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

After a quick lunch, Dave grabbed his stuff and headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat early in the afternoon. The whales had headed southeast towards Lawrence Point on Orcas Island and the leaders were just rounding the point when “Orcinus” arrived on scene around 1415. J pod and L87 were strung out in small groups over a half mile with most of them within a quarter mile of the Orcas Island shoreline. The whales moved offshore near the Peapod Rocks with most of the whales passing them on the east side. J pod then traveled slowly down Rosario Strait, loosely strung out, but still mostly in one group. By 1525, the whales were off of Peavine Pass when they took a hard right and headed inshore towards both Peavine and Obstruction Passes. Some whales spread out and seemed to be foraging along the Orcas Island while others socialized. The leaders moved slowly to the north over a half mile away from the trailers. The trailing group was a large group of socializing whales with a few foraging outliers. L87 made his way back out into the middle off Rosario Strait and was lost from sight although he could be heard blowing when the engine was off. The lead animals formed up into a group that included the J11s, J19s, and J22s. This group made it to about Doe Bay by 1655 before they turned around and headed back toward the trailers. The trailers, meanwhile, had picked up their pace and were heading towards leaders. The groups soon met up and, with the exception L87 and maybe another straggler or two, most of J pod headed slowly north together in a loose group.

The whales were zig-zagging and apparently socializing after having made a kill earlier in the day. The team stayed for a couple surfacing sequences and made sure that the whole group was present. Reports over the radio indicated that there were whales inshore of the southern group that may have been the missing whales from the previous passes. The team headed southwest and waited for the group north of Lime Kiln. Soon, the group came travelling north, keeping close to the shoreline, still steadily travelling and spread out. After a few surfacing sequences, the team did get ID shots of T124A3, T124A3A, and T124A4. At 1430, the team ended the encounter, although there was word on the radio that there was another group of whales nearby, other than the whales that had already been documented.​Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

        summary: "Michael received a report from Jane Cogan about transient calls on Haro Strait hydrophones, and later visual confirmation of a group of whales in mid Haro headed towards Kelp Reef. At 1030, Dave and Michael left Snug to try to locate and ID the whales. At 1050, they arrived on scene southwest of Kelp Reef with the T46Bs, T36As, T65Bs, and T77A. The whales were socializing, and milling non-directionally. At 1130, the whales split into two groups. The T36As, T65Bs, and T77A headed northwest, moving quickly, with T77A separated from the rest of the group by nearly a mile. The T46Bs, meanwhile, headed south down Haro Strait. The team spent a bit of time trying to keep up with the northern group, before flipping to get more photos of the T46Bs, particularly interested in further assessing T46B1B’s skin condition. At 1215, the team ended the encounter in mid Haro Strait, just west of Lime Kiln park.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"

        summary: "Mark and Dave did a survey on Saturday all the way out the Strait of Juan de Fuca and past Carmanah Point. We checked out a couple of corners of Swiftsure Bank and found some scattered humpbacks but no killer whales. On our way back in from the bank, Mark spotted some blows a couple miles to the northeast of Cape Flattery. The whales turned out to be the T37As heading east in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The T37As traveled in a tight group with a newish calf tight by T37A's side. The calf did briefly travel between a pair of siblings before returning to T37A’s side. We stayed with the group for 25 minutes and left them still traveling in an easterly direction at 1805.Photos taken under Federal PermitsNMFS PERMIT: 21238/ DFO SARA 388"
